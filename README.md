# Abstract

With Windows 10 supporting an unprecedented number of platforms and form factors (from IOT to phones to tablets to laptops and desktops to XBOX and SurfaceHub, and even the new HoloGraphic computer HoloLens), the name 'Windows 10 Universal application' is fairly accurate. But to be honest, shouldn't a truly Universal application run on Windows 7, iOS and Android devices too? Thankfully, this is possible thanks to a clever architecture pattern named Model-View-ViewModel, the .NET portable class libraries and the Xamarin frameworks. With these tools, we can structure an application so that most of the code is shared across all the platforms, and then build truly native UI that adapts without any compromises to the device it runs on. In this session, we will understand exactly how such universal applications are built. Laurent Bugnion, a XAML/C# expert, Microsoft and Xamarin MVP who started making universal applications before it was even a thing, will show you practical knowledge with a lot of demos. Come listen from the creator of the popular MVVM Light Toolkit how this powerful but simple library can be leveraged to help you target more users than you ever dreamed of!
